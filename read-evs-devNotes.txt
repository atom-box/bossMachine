SERVER.JS
1-parse
2-CORS
3-listen 
This is big.  Holds most of the non-router middleware.
app.use...
require...

DATA_STRUCT.js
Unofficial.
I made this as a scratchpad for writing the data objects.

INDEX.HTML
Front end; don't touch.  
Built in react.js, I think.

API.JS (in Server folder)
All routes start here !
1-minions
2-ideas
3-meetings 
Probably need to all have their own folders.

DB.JS (in Server folder)
Your non-persistant data has to re-start here every time the app runs.  
Write custom functions your routes can use.  Export!
Write these seven functions here:
const LOVELYNAME = () => {}; 
const LOVELYNAME = (a|b|c|d) => {}; 

where abcd can be
`'minions'`, `'ideas'`, `'meetings'`, or `'work'`.
These titles:
`getAllFromDatabase`
`getFromDatabaseById`
`addToDatabase`
`updateInstanceInDatabase`
`deleteFromDatabasebyId`:
`deleteAllFromDatabase`:

ROUTES.JS (in Server folder)

CHECK-M-D-IDEA.JS (in Server folder)
